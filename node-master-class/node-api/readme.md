# This is first api based on the Pirple.com Node Master Class Course.

    - some observations about this API:
        - we dont use the express for API development.
        - some new modification
        
        
        
       finalized with just login page + index page + my profile page
       
       how to test:
       
        node index.js from node-api folder;
        enter: localhost:xxxx
        - username: b8dabd40-a24c-11ec-8bda-2ddb34e3a703
        - password: 123456
       y'll be redirect to index page and y'll be able to see the information about name age
       name and surname
       
       
       
       the JS scripts for fill the information above commented was made just to test and not is the very effective wall to do what was did;
